# Server (Beta)

You can self-host your GOD (iof you want) just start a webserver with your fav. application. [All files are avbl. via GitLab](https://gitlab.com/CHEF-KOCH/good-old-downloads), because GitHub is a back of ~~dicks~~ flowers. 

Alternatively if you want to use a pre-made one  [you can visit this repo](https://festive-jones-b87f33.netlify.com/).
