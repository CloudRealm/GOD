# Server (Beta)

You can self-host your GOD (iof you want) just start a webserver with your fav. application. 

Alternatively if you want to use a pre-made one  [you can visit this repo](https://festive-jones-b87f33.netlify.com/).


### Mirror

An up2date mirror dump can be found under the [release](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/GOD/releases) tab here on GitHub or as [plain file on Google Drive (more frequently updated)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BUaOav4t84TQIGSqBaWblFnHcb3Y2zW5?usp=sharing).

# Project Goal & Todo

[A reboot would be cool right?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/a3d9h0/would_you_pay_2_dollars_a_month_for_a/) But there are some things whhich has to be done first:

* Provide a search index to filter games/release data etc. 
* Automatically mirror upload in case a release/hoster is offline (ultimately every file on the server would bbe cool to ensure everyone can download the files without having the fear to get infected by some bullshit file-hoster or imposter websites.
